# Fitness Management App

It's a fitness management application that I developed as the final project for my COMP 3005 (Database Management Systems) course. It is built using **PostgreSQL**, **React**, **Material UI**, and **Node.js**, and supports three distinct account types: Admin, Manager, and Trainer.

## Key Functionalities

- **Trainer Availability Management:**  
  Trainers can set and manage their available times.

- **Class and Trainer Assignment:**  
  Admins can create group classes and assign trainers to these classes based on their availability.

- **User Scheduling:**  
  Users can enroll in group classes and schedule one-on-one sessions with trainers, aligning with the trainers' schedules.
