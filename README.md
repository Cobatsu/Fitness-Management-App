# Fitness Management Application

This fitness management application was developed as a project for my **Database Management System** course (COMP 3005). It is built using **PostgreSQL**, **React**, **Material UI**, and **Node.js**, and supports three distinct account types: Admin, Manager, and Trainer.

## Key Functionalities

- **Trainer Availability Management:**  
  Trainers can set and manage their available times.

- **Class and Trainer Assignment:**  
  Admins can create group classes and assign trainers to these classes based on their availability.

- **User Scheduling:**  
  Users can enroll in group classes and schedule one-on-one sessions with trainers, aligning with the trainers' schedules.

- **Equipment and Billing Monitoring:**  
  Admins can oversee the status of gym equipment and track users' billing histories.
